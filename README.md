## Overview

This repository showcases a series of daily data projects aimed at exploring various data analysis techniques and methodologies using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Structure

- **day1_hello.ipynb**: Introduction to the project and initial data exploration.
- **day2_data_operations.ipynb**: Performing basic data operations and manipulations.
- **day3_missing_values.ipynb**: Handling and imputing missing data in datasets.
- **day4_data_scaling.ipynb**: Techniques for data scaling and normalization.
- **cleaned_data.csv**: Dataset resulting from data cleaning processes.
- **scaled_data.csv**: Dataset after applying scaling techniques.

## Getting Started

To explore these projects:
