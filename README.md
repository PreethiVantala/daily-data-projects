# 🚀 Daily Data Projects  

Welcome to **Daily Data Projects**! This repository contains a collection of daily hands-on data analysis projects using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Each project explores different data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning techniques.  

## 📁 Project Structure  

📌 **Day 1:** `day1_hello.ipynb` → Introduction to the project and initial data exploration  
📌 **Day 2:** `day2_data_operations.ipynb` → Performing basic data operations and manipulations  
📌 **Day 3:** `day3_missing_values.ipynb` → Handling and imputing missing data in datasets  
📌 **Day 4:** `day4_data_scaling.ipynb` → Techniques for data scaling and normalization  

📊 **Datasets Used:**  
- `cleaned_data.csv` → Dataset after cleaning  
- `scaled_data.csv` → Dataset after applying scaling techniques
